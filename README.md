# CS 257 VS Code Debugging Demo

These demos are meant to correspond to sections 3.6 - 3.9 of our book.
I use the same examples, but emphasize how the steps can be performed
using VS Code.

The videos are available at:

3.6: Stepping
    - devcontainer.json
    - settings.json
    - tasks.json
    - launch.json

3.7: TODO
3.8: TODO
3.9: TODO
